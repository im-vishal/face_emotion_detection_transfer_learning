# Face Emotion Recognition through Transfer-Learning

Face emotion detection has become a very interesting problem in image processing and computer vision.

I've used the [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013?resource=download) data provided on kaggle for the training and testing of my model.

I've used MobileNetV2 model for transfer learning and prediction of the data.

Along with the image prediction, I'm also providing the code to detect the emotion on real time video capturing using the same model.
